# Gatsby Markdown Viewer

## What
Gatsby Markdown Viewer is a project that I completed to teach myself React and Gatsby.js

## Who
[Alexander Garcia](https://alexandergarcia.me) - me

## Why
Why do I continually build things?  Because I believe that when you are **struggling** is when you learn the most!  It helps you deepen the knowledge you already possess, and helps you continually build upon that foundation.

I don't know it all, but I try my hardest to become better every day.  #AlwaysLearning

## How
