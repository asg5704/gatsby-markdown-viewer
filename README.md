# Gatsby Markdown Viewer

## What
Gatsby Markdown Viewer is a project based on the freeCodeCamp curriculum to fulfill the Front End Libraries Certification.

## Who
[Alexander Garcia](https://alexandergarcia.me) - me

## Why
Why do I continually build things?  Because I believe that when you are **struggling** is when you learn the most!  It helps you deepen the knowledge you already possess, and helps you continually build upon that foundation.

I don't know it all, but I try my hardest to become better every day.  #AlwaysLearning

## How
<div align="center">
  <p>A major thanks to [Taylor Bryant](https://github.com/taylorbryant) for creating the Gatsby Starter Tailwind, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for blazing-fast JAMStack awesomeness, and [TailwindCSS] for an amazing CSS Framework for rapid UI development.
